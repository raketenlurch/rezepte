# Easy peasy mac 'n' cheese
## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp plain flour
- 568 ml milk
- 1 handful cheese, grated
- 250 g macaroni
- 1 handful fresh tomatoes
- 1 slice stale bread
- 1 sprig fresh oregano
- 1 clove of garlic

## Step 1 - Preheat oven & boil water
Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. 

## Step 2 - Make the roux
Melt the butter in another pan and then stir in the flour to form a paste.

## Step 3 - Cook the pasta
Dump the macaroni into the boiling water, stir and cook for a minute less than 
the packet instructions (will depend on the size of the macaroni, probably 
about 6-8 minutes).

## Step 4 - Make the sauce
Pour the milk into the flour paste a bit at a time, making sure it's well 
combined and boiling again before pouring in the next batch. This makes sure it
ends up lump free. Allow the white sauce to bubble for 2 minutes and then 
season well with salt and pepper.

## Step 5 - Mix in the cheese
Drain the pasta when ready and return back to the dry, but hot pan. Remove the
sauce from the heat and stir through the grated cheese to melt.

## Step 6 - Combine the sauce & pasta
Combine the sauce and pasta together and transfer all into a deep oven-proof 
dish.

## Step 7 - Top with breadcrumps!
Blitz the bread with the garlic clove and fresh oregano to form breadcrumbs. 
Slice the tomatoes and lay on top of the pasta before sprinkling over the herby
garlic crumbs.

## Step 8 - Bake n serve!
Bake for 10-15 mins until golden on top and serve immediately with a fresh 
salad. Serves 2.
